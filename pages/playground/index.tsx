      "Lester was a level 2 software engineer on a development team that I managed. Shortly after hiring him, I was quickly impressed by his willingness and ability to dive into unfamiliar territory and make progress with very ambiguous requirements. Lester values modern software development practices and has very up-to-date knowledge on the latest tools, technologies, and practices. Given a daunting task in a complex codebase, he is not afraid to dive in and figure out how to get the job done. I also valued Lesterâ€™s willingness to unblock teammates and provide suggestions when people were stuck on a problem. Overall, Lester is a productive software engineer who excels at solving challenging technical problems.",
